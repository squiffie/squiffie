medkit fictkin, i am perfectly fine with doubles thoughüëç
hk + filo, minor, use he/him only unless we're very close. inxj 5w6 (or 6w5 i'm not sure)
i'm usually in the phighting area or sitting with my friends + my s/o
c+h, crowns, items, ints, etc. are always appreciated, if i'm afk i highly urge you to whisper so i can thank you later
sometimes i swear/make tasteless jokes around close friends so tell me if you're uncomfy
feel free to friend me/ask for my disc if we've talked a little too, it takes a while for me to warm up to new people though so be patient
