## basics
you may call me enigma, eni, squiffy, medkit, or by whatever skin i have on 

medkit fictkin, i am perfectly fine with doubles thoughüëç

hk + filo, minor, use he/him only unless we're very close. inxj 5w6 (or 6w5 i'm not sure)

i'm usually in the phighting area or sitting with my friends and/or my s/o

c+h, crowns, items, ints, etc. are always appreciated, if i'm afk i highly urge you to whisper so i can thank you later

sometimes i swear/make tasteless jokes around close friends so tell me if you're uncomfy

feel free to friend me/ask for my disc if we've talked a little too, it takes a while for me to warm up to new people though so be patient

inspo is okay so long as you ask beforehand--don't heavy inspo or copy my skins though (idrc if you do though honestly)
